### CoF KPD - Questions for the Team:

#### 

\## Your goal should be to get clarity on scope, timeline pressures, and practical resource options.

\### Understanding the dependency

* What are the exact tasks that only Andrew can perform right now?
* Which of these tasks are critical path vs. lower risk if delayed?
* Can we break Andrew’s role into smaller components for easier delegation?

Resource \& capability exploration

* Which team members (Tom, Sean, others) could realistically be freed up for shadowing?
* What percentage of their time could be committed without derailing other priorities?





* Could we formalise a phased knowledge transfer plan, starting with the most time-sensitive skills?
* What format would work best for documenting processes (written, video, walkthrough tools)?
* How do we balance time spent on knowledge transfer vs. keeping up delivery pace?
  

\## Risk \& contingency planning

* What’s our contingency if Andrew becomes unavailable tomorrow?
* Have we identified other hidden KPDs in the migration that could cause similar issues?
* Is there scope to adjust delivery sequencing to de-risk the dependency earlier?

* How do we ensure this knowledge is embedded into at least two roles at all times?
* Can migration tasks be designed in a way that new team members can self-learn more easily next time?
* How do we make KPD mitigation part of BAU planning beyond this project?
