### 1\. Mitigation Strategies for Key Person Dependency

The aim is to reduce the delivery risk if Andrew is unavailable, while also building resilience in the long term.

Short-term tactical mitigations (to safeguard against immediate risk)

Shadowing \& Pairing Approach

* Assign Tom and/or Sean to work alongside Andrew in a shadow capacity for key migration tasks.
* Use “learning by doing” — have them support in discrete, low-risk tasks to gradually absorb Andrew’s knowledge without overwhelming him.
* Focus on high-priority knowledge transfer that covers “must-have” skills first.

Structured Knowledge Capture
* Create “how-to” documentation, process maps, and walk-through videos of Andrew’s workflows.
* Store this centrally in a shared repository so others can reference it if needed.
* Use bite-sized training sessions to avoid excessive interruptions to Andrew’s work.

Risk-buffered Planning
* Adjust migration timelines to allow for knowledge transfer activities and potential disruptions.
* Identify the most critical path elements and ensure at least two people are able to perform them.



Cross-team Resource Pooling
* Temporarily free up capacity in Tom and Sean’s current work (reprioritise pricing or BI tasks) so they can dedicate more focused time to migration tasks.
* Work with management to negotiate priority shifts.

Medium to Long-term resilience building

Formal Upskilling Program

Implement a 4–6 week structured induction for backup team members, including:
* Systems training
* Scenario-based problem solving
* Worked examples of migration challenges

Dual Role Capability
* Create role rotation or dual-ownership for high-risk skill areas to ensure continuous backup coverage.
* Dependency Heatmap
* Maintain an up-to-date register of KPD risks across the programme, with assigned mitigation owners and timelines.
* Allows proactive intervention for future potential single points of failure.

Use of External Specialists Strategically

Instead of engaging KPMG for full delivery (which Ben warns is inefficient), consider a specific scoped engagement where they validate knowledge capture or help create tooling/automation to reduce reliance on bespoke knowledge.

Automate \& Simplify

Where possible, invest in scripts/tools that encapsulate Andrew’s expertise in reusable form — reducing reliance on tacit knowledge.
