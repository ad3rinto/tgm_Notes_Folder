DDMS

The bug has been fixed.
Andrew has rerun and tested his scripts and the results are in line with desired outcome.
We requested test account from Kate, but there appears to be none, so we will have to perform the proposed validation assessment with a live account.
Next steps:
Agree accounts to use. ( one with 1 day, 3 days and 12 days before payment due), accounts nust not have missing address fields.
Monitor Accounts over the respective periods
Based on outcome, determine if to roll out in full
Schedule roll out
Remediate accounts ( where necessary)
